11.55	25.92	<font color='sienna'>About her rather. Witnessing the vernacular project Alma said into the microphone, 'The Black Back-ups,' by Kate Rushin. She stepped around the table, a stack of photocopies held lightly in her arm</font>	Transcription
25.92	38.73	<font color='sienna'>and smiling now, she divided the pile among several people sitting in the first row of chairs in the small lecture hall, indicating that each should take a copy and pass the rest on. Had project</font>	Transcription
38.76	51.18	<font color='sienna'>sounded a little pretentious, she wondered. She had rejected aspects of the vernacular as conventional beyond bearing. 'Two white boy,' Thelma had called it and vernacular element elements that</font>	Transcription
51.18	63.18	<font color='sienna'>sounded well, too elementary, especially before this audience of literary scholars. There had been no cries of outrage when she announced her title of course, Alma had the grace to laugh at herself,</font>	Transcription
63.51	74.46	<font color='sienna'>but she observed silently there had been no other reactions either. She resumed her seat behind the table with the other panelists, folded her hands a topic and looked out at the audience saying</font>	Transcription
74.46	86.91	<font color='sienna'>nothing. It wasn't unheard of for historians to talk about poetry and culture. Though Alma admitted they usually did so uninvited by literary scholars, who seemed at this blush anyway, to be less</font>	Transcription
86.91	100.41	<font color='sienna'>territorial than historians, which Alma was and apparently better known than she thought, or philosophers for that matter. Still, the invitation to talk about the vernacular, common everyday speech</font>	Transcription
100.59	113.34	<font color='sienna'>and Afro-American culture at a national conference on Afro-American poetry had come as a surprise to her. She was a Victorianist is by training and Afro-Americanist almost by default. Of course, much</font>	Transcription
113.34	127.05	<font color='sienna'>of her work on the Diaspora was drawn from unwritten sources, oral tellings of a so-called vernacular source, her lips twisted rhyly, vernacular was from the Latin word vernaculus, meaning domestic</font>	Transcription
127.08	139.71	<font color='sienna'>according to Web Webster, its root word verna meant home-born slave. The African sources of her work were not from slaves, their language was not common or every day, though it was spoken and in some</font>	Transcription
139.71	152.64	<font color='sienna'>cases never written down until she transcribed it. Only wealthy Africans or those otherwise renowned were named in the accounts passed on by word-of-mouth and retold and sung in each generation. Oral</font>	Transcription
152.64	162.81	<font color='sienna'>culture would always come out on the short end of the stick when pitted against written records, Alma thought glumly. It was only a poem because it was written. If it didn't work on the page, it</font>	Transcription
162.81	175.47	<font color='sienna'>didn't work at all, if it could not be recorded, it didn't exist beyond the moment. The only thing Alma thought again, that it saved negros from extinction was radio and records, which would also be</font>	Transcription
175.47	186.57	<font color='sienna'>the instrument of our destruction, for hadn't records especially laid bare the very heart of the culture for every enterprising white boy in the world to bleed. 'Negro' was the common everyday speech</font>	Transcription
186.6	199.62	<font color='sienna'>of America, and any poetry that called itself African American couldn't help but be steeped in it. Vernacular in that old sense, was an apt description of New World Africans, those Afro-Brazilians and</font>	Transcription
199.65	212.16	<font color='sienna'>Afro-Cubans, Afro Americans descended from the kidnapped and enslaved verna, home-born slave. And thus the continuing binary between slave and master seemed to make little difference that they were</font>	Transcription
212.16	225.48	<font color='sienna'>also descended from the slave owners too as well as the slave by culture, if not by actual blood. Her history, the very intellectual tradition in which she labored always came back to slavery. And</font>	Transcription
225.51	237.18	<font color='sienna'>historian though she was, Alma was tired of slavery. Took too much time in the conversation to review the century-old horrors but one could not assume that everyone knew them or understood that</font>	Transcription
237.18	250.92	<font color='sienna'>slavery affected people's lives long after its abolition. Thank goodness this audience would know all that. Still, no one in it had yet spoken. Alma looked down at the paper before her. Kate Rushin,</font>	Transcription
251.22	264.3	<font color='sienna'>'The Black Back-ups.' This is dedicated to Mary Clayton, Cissy Houston and was caught as she had been on first reading by Clayton's name hearing that powerful alto bellowing got a case of the steam</font>	Transcription
264.33	281.97	<font color='sienna'>ro-o-o-o-ola. The word drawn out in the voice fading to silence. Tap, tap, a cowbell beaten by a drumstick. Three, four alone off mic male voice blues. Alma tore her eyes away lest she be drawn</font>	Transcription
282.18	294.12	<font color='sienna'>completely into the world of the poem. Neither project nor element seemed an adequate description of the wild invention and fusion that seemed renewed and expanded in each reading of the poem. No,</font>	Transcription
294.24	307.86	<font color='sienna'>Alma told herself now. Project was both mask on image and buzzword and she could not but be pleased with her title. If she let it, the names in the poem would draw her on as they must now be drawing</font>	Transcription
307.86	320.25	<font color='sienna'>the audience past the dedication into narrative plaints so widely voiced it was now almost formula. Bump up against old ironies cast in a new light, half forgotten memories reveal now as rites of</font>	Transcription
320.25	331.86	<font color='sienna'>passage phrases playfully turned and twisted. The reader made into part of the chorus. Not the doo-wop girls, the white boys rave about but the girls who sang back-up on there is something on your</font>	Transcription
331.86	345.06	<font color='sienna'>mind the parody, doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo. Yes, Alma told herself. Even nodded a little. There would be plenty of discussion when they finished reading. Smile, smiling slightly, she</font>	Transcription
345.06	345.84	<font color='sienna'>leaned forward.</font>	Transcription
347.31	357.06	<font color='sienna'>Thelma had actually thought she was doing Alma a favor when she'd suggested Alma's name for this panel. Thelma wrote about the broad range of black woman's literature, though in recent years, she had</font>	Transcription
357.06	367.23	<font color='sienna'>focused her attention on the rich turn-of-the-century period, and the first literary outpourings of the free people. Alma had some interest in the period, had met Thelma at a couple of conferences and</font>	Transcription
367.23	379.95	<font color='sienna'>been drawn by the sharp womanist analysis the sister brought to every discussion. Alma had temporized about the invitation. She read some poetry, of course and fiction, but to talk about either one to</font>	Transcription
379.95	391.77	<font color='sienna'>an audience of people who talked and wrote about them for a living, held no appeal to her. She would check her schedule, she told the voice on the phone, get back to them. She called Thelma. Just talk</font>	Transcription
391.77	404.19	<font color='sienna'>about what you know, Thelma said non-literary sources of cultural documentation and occupa- and academic scholarship sounded dull as dust at a poetry conference, Alma objected. Then just do a</font>	Transcription
404.19	415.74	<font color='sienna'>conventional history. After all, history is your thing, outlining uses of the vernacular and literary poetry, a development with which Alma was at least somewhat familiar, identifying vernacular</font>	Transcription
415.77	428.46	<font color='sienna'>idioms and literate sources was a way of documenting traditionalist sentiment otherwise unrecorded among pre-literate peoples, And Alma had began her research with Lucy Terry Prince. Eunice Allen see</font>	Transcription
428.46	440.7	<font color='sienna'>the Indians coming and hope to save herself by running and had not her petticoat stopped her. The awful creatures have not caught her and Tommy hocked her on the ground for dead. Alma's lips quirked</font>	Transcription
440.7	452.31	<font color='sienna'>at the grim humour of the remembered lines, but it taken a graduate student to make her see that humor in the rough rhythms of Terry's lines. Her notes highlighted Paul Laurence Dunbar's contributions</font>	Transcription
452.49	466.29	<font color='sienna'>in removing as his contemporary James Weldon Johnson had said much of the course negronis from the so-called nigra dialect coined by whites at the turn of the century. And she contrasted him with his</font>	Transcription
466.44	483.99	<font color='sienna'>contemporary James Weldon Johnson, who had taken the process even further. Preparing a field for the authentic dictions of Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown and so on and so forth. Even now, Alma was</font>	Transcription
484.02	495.87	<font color='sienna'>a little saddened by the musical about Paul Laurence Dunbar and James Weldon Johnson's the time that each of these had spent on Broadway that had never been written, would probably never be, at least</font>	Transcription
495.87	509.79	<font color='sienna'>in her lifetime written, nor would the tragedy of split literary persona of their split of the split literary persona, that neither they nor their lineal descendant Sterling Brown had ever overcome.</font>	Transcription
510.06	521.73	<font color='sienna'>One voice to speak for the people, the folk who can't make the book talk for themselves. Another standard voice to speak for the low college educated me. She would never see a performance of asking</font>	Transcription
521.73	533.1	<font color='sienna'>mama or the animated feature that should have been made from montage on a dream deferred. Alma lamented and play the blues while she read, took notes, wrote, but convention hadn't worked. Not even</font>	Transcription
533.1	545.04	<font color='sienna'>when she fell back on style. The kind of anecdotal irreverent chitchat she and Thelma often shared about the period. Papers rustled in the audience. A chair scraped. Alma looked out at out at the</font>	Transcription
545.04	557.1	<font color='sienna'>people. Maybe that was what they came for convention, what she should have given them. But she hadn't found the words for even that. You could talk about violence's vernacular Pearl had said when Alma</font>	Transcription
557.1	569.04	<font color='sienna'>consulted her Pearl was a writer, novelist, little known and journalist. She actually earned a close but stable living from the reams of opinions, interviews, features and ghosted speeches that</font>	Transcription
569.07	582.75	<font color='sienna'>streamed from her printer. Pearl made Alma listen to Baraka's poem from my father-in-law, but just the mention of Amiri Baraka's name, aka Leroy Jones, made Alma uneasy. Baraka was part of the madness</font>	Transcription
582.75	594.81	<font color='sienna'>of the 70s coined traditions and a violent and vicious chauvinism. She said none of this allowed, of course, time was too short to be getting into an argument with Pearl. Besides, and this she had</font>	Transcription
594.81	606.99	<font color='sienna'>said aloud, Leroy did his best work in the post-Beat period, the late 50s and early 60s. It's the politics, isn't it, his radical Marxism. Pearl had taunted and shoved a book open to the Crow Jane</font>	Transcription
606.99	620.67	<font color='sienna'>series under Alma's nose. Stung, Alma retorted more like sexual gluttony and narcissism. Pearl had backed off then or talk about jazz as both vernacular and haute couture. She'd offered in compromise,</font>	Transcription
620.82	634.02	<font color='sienna'>and referred Alma to Michael Harper and Yusef Komunyakaa. But Alma found a way to say what interested her about their poems, let alone what might interest a roomful of literary critics. Alma tuned</font>	Transcription
634.02	635.13	<font color='sienna'>into spoken word.</font>	Transcription
637.61	650.85	<font color='sienna'>And saw even the and saw how even the best especially the best of these poets were seduced into stand-up or sing silently for whatever reason, on sight. She tried to listen to rap, but it made her</font>	Transcription
650.917	664.225	<font color='sienna'>feel too white. Hip hop was no substitute for song. What little she understood of the lyrics of hardcore, offended and repelled her, she refused to return to the blues as a matter of principle. She</font>	Transcription
664.292	677.735	<font color='sienna'>had never gone with a man who wore hydrate pants, nor worked in a house of the rising sun. And while she often admired this one's technique, or that one's artistry, she didn't believe that anyone who</font>	Transcription
677.803	691.245	<font color='sienna'>now saying of having done so, had ever, ever had either, no matter how well they reproduced blues form. Rap was the only form to evolve from contemporary circumstances. But the circumstances of which</font>	Transcription
691.313	704.755	<font color='sienna'>they spoke were not hers. She watched videos and went to galleries and clubs, deciding that what we mean when we said vernacular, was really what we mean when we said Black. The truth was that all of</font>	Transcription
704.823	718.266	<font color='sienna'>it--spoken word hardcore hip hop, performance, installation, whatever--spoke to her but did not move her to speak, or at least to write the little occasional paper she had expected to produce. Horace</font>	Transcription
718.333	731.776	<font color='sienna'>sent her a copy of the jazz poetry anthology, and she had seen in its title a fusion of low, that is, vernacular of slaves, for jazz was certainly that and high culture, and so-called high culture in</font>	Transcription
731.844	745.286	<font color='sienna'>less than a century in American life. She found in Rushin's poem the need for a word other than vernacular to describe the fusion, she read there. Freedom came out of crossbreeding between master and</font>	Transcription
745.354	758.729	<font color='sienna'>slave, a kind of freedom at least, if the scatting meant anything in the poem, she thought, and she couldn't be sure of that until she heard the poem performed, it invited you to see that classless,</font>	Transcription
758.796	772.239	<font color='sienna'>castless and egalitarian society freedom or did it just mean that these were so much false hope. Beside her, the previous speaker coughed nervously into his cupped hand. Alma turned an inquiring face</font>	Transcription
772.307	785.817	<font color='sienna'>to the panel moderator who was staring at her. She turned back to the audience and waited. Is that it? An incredulous make voice called from the back of the room. Sir, did you read the poem? she asked</font>	Transcription
785.885	798.989	<font color='sienna'>politely. There was some muffled laughter papers rustled softly and still as people began to read the two pages she'd handed out and Alma looked at the narrator expectantly. He nodded and smiled</font>	Transcription
799.057	812.365	<font color='sienna'>encouragingly. She leaned forward into her microphone, The End. The moderator stared at her again, Well, you can at least read the poem. He seems she noted rather peeved, which rather peeved her as</font>	Transcription

1516.7	1527.17	<font color='slateblue'>them as in the, in the, in the realm of the folk, although I don't want to get into dichotomizations either. Because I think things should go together rather than be, rather than be separated. So I</font>	Transcription

1563.18	1577.765	<font color='slateblue'>moment, especially, yeah. But I think that things have to be integrated in art. I'm not fully given over to the idea that poetry is just for performance, I will never be given a because there are</font>	Transcription

1607.608	1622.492	<font color='slateblue'>great potential in that book for development along that line. But then Haki stopped writing poetry. He started writing aphorisms, you see, but I can understand that too, because he's an activist. And</font>	Transcription

1674.55	1686.37	about, and how it's meant to be read, in the oral tradition. I'm wondering, I've heard a lot of different people read a lot of different poems: the author, him or herself, and then other poets or	Transcription
1686.37	1696.6	other people. And I'm wondering if there's a danger at all, in doing that, because every time the poem is, is read by different people, it sounds different all of the time. And I get different things	Transcription
1696.6	1707.52	out of the poem. And I'm wondering if there's ever a danger in performance, when it's not done by the author themselves of it being misconstrued, or the aesthetics and what the author or poet was	Transcription

1726.1	1739.36	<font color='sienna'>that danger is there, whether the poem is actually read, or whether it is being, you know, performed by somebody else other than the author. And to me, in a way, it is, in fact, a kind of, let me say</font>	Transcription
1739.36	1752.8	two things: In a way, it's like the mark of a great work of art that, in fact, you get multiple and variable kinds of meanings out of it, it shouldn't mean that exactly the same thing every single	Transcription
1753.01	1769.51	time. That's not art that's repetition. And, and that's rote, and at the same time, I do think that it's a good thing that somebody else performs the poem, and does it in a different way and is able	Transcription
1769.51	1778.9	to see and to bring forth to evoke different kinds of nuances. I think that that's all a part of what the artistic spirit experience itself is supposed to be.	Transcription

1885.58	1903.58	<font color='sienna'>whatever reason, tend to ignore it. And in some ways, that's a bad thing, because it gives a kind of skewed aspect to the culture. We, as far as anybody outside of the culture knows, we are a totally,</font>	Transcription
1903.88	1916.15	<font color='sienna'>almost a completely secular people. And that whatever, you know, our spiritual life is, it doesn't have any bearing on the quote unquote, culture we create, which is how you can get into calling some</font>	Transcription
1916.15	1928.87	<font color='sienna'>of these calling a lot of things that that are questionable, or at least controversial, as far as culture is concerned, calling a culture, right, but it's there for the people inside of the culture</font>	Transcription
1928.87	1941.2	<font color='sienna'>itself. I mean, it becomes almost like all something secret and hidden. And because it is secret, and hidden, it's not as open to exploitation, and misuse in the way that other aspects of the culture</font>	Transcription
1941.2	1956.59	<font color='sienna'>have become a kind of like the common property of everybody, of everybody in America. Some of that may be breaking down now, because more people inside of the culture inside of the field, are saying</font>	Transcription

1970.78	1981.13	<font color='sienna'>create all over and that we have always created within the church. And what we've done is, you know, really helped to change what the definition of church and what the definition of religion, what the</font>	Transcription

2734.281	2747.799	<font color='indigo'>this, I think this Ellison quote is really important and, and, and helpful, We create the race by creating ourselves and then to our great astonishment, we will have created something far more</font>	Transcription
2747.869	2761.528	<font color='indigo'>important, we will have created a culture. So, I think in a way, one answer to your question, which may sound like a cop out, but I don't think that it is, is that you know, it is for each black</font>	Transcription
2761.598	2775.679	<font color='indigo'>person to listen to those voices and answer for themselves, what is to be salvaged? What is to be refigured? What is useful? And what is their particular vision of their own black selves? And then and</font>	Transcription
2775.749	2789.76	<font color='indigo'>then how does that fit into a larger context? Because I do think that in the post-integration era that we're in now, that questions of, you know, who are my relatives who are my ancestors, I do think</font>	Transcription
2789.83	2803.489	<font color='indigo'>that they're, they're more complicated, more complicated to negotiate. So I think that it's some not necessarily saying that each person needs to be solipsistic, to say that each person needs to</font>	Transcription
2803.559	2817.429	<font color='indigo'>answer that question for themselves. And then perhaps even, we could say, it's not necessarily the writers role, but it's, you know, sort of critics and commentators role to be additive and to say,</font>	Transcription
2817.499	2831.51	<font color='indigo'>Well, you know, I see this poet and this poet in this, let's, let's step back and see what's happening in in black expressive culture at this moment, and not so much for the individual writer to have</font>	Transcription
2831.58	2836.72	<font color='indigo'>to place themselves in history of the present tense. That's what I'd say.</font>	Transcription

3074.07	3089.01	<font color='chartreuse'>poets amongst themselves talk about writing poems that will turn people inside out. But we don't talk about that either as a political issue or an aesthetic issue. Do you think that people, is there a</font>	Transcription

3121.89	3136.17	<font color='sienna'>also? Or, or what? But it also seems to me that what you are talking about, for me, at least is a very, you know, private kind of question. And that while I'm willing to, you know, to really talk</font>	Transcription
3136.17	3151.41	<font color='sienna'>about technique, and how you achieve certain kinds of effects, I'm less willing to talk about what for me is like the beginning or, you know, on and on, in those kinds of terms, because, as I say, I</font>	Transcription
3151.41	3163.86	<font color='sienna'>mean, it is very personal, it is very private. And in some sense, I guess, I kind of have the feeling that when you begin to probe too deeply into certain sources of your own art, at least for me, I,</font>	Transcription
3164.37	3178.53	<font color='sienna'>I just really want to back away, I'm not wanting to expose that in the way that something has to be exposed, or at least the attempt made when you begin to put certain things into words.</font>	Transcription

3192.97	3206.29	<font color='indigo'>much informed by his being Bahai but also I think, is explicitly striving to address some of the spiritual questions that you seem to be interested in. And also, there's a new book by Cyrus Cassells,</font>	Transcription

3230.22	3242.22	<font color='crimson'>me why a poem should have more than one meaning. I, as a poet, sometimes when I write, I only have one thing to say, and that's exactly what I mean, when I put it down. Why do you feel that it is</font>	Transcription
3243.03	3246.66	<font color='crimson'>wonderful for a poem to have so many different meanings?</font>	Transcription

3247.26	3255.84	<font color='sienna'><font color='sienna'><b>I don't think I actually said so many different meanings. I said something about, you know, bring evoking different nuances. And, you know, that kind of thing that it doesn't</b></font></font>	Transcription
3255.99	3268.02	<font color='sienna'>mean exactly the same thing every single time. But even though you have said exactly what you want to say in your poem, doesn't mean that I'm going to get exactly what you have said out of it. I may,</font>	Transcription
3268.02	3279.93	<font color='sienna'>in fact find not something we hope you know, an entirely different because I think if it's an entirely different from what you intended, then you the writer has failed, but that I may find something</font>	Transcription
3279.93	3294.15	<font color='sienna'>more than what you intended. And, you know, using what you you know, the basic word, I may in fact come to you know, something that you know, you may have wanted me to get to A and I get to A and go</font>	Transcription
3294.15	3309.78	<font color='sienna'>on to B because it's there impossible given the associations of images of words of sounds and those kinds of things. If you don't get something different, not so much different, but something new, a</font>	Transcription
3309.78	3324.93	<font color='sienna'>kind of refreshed feeling out of a work of art, whether it is a poem or a picture or a whatever, then as I say, I don't believe that it really it's not doing its job, that you want to find something</font>	Transcription
3325.29	3337.41	<font color='sienna'>else there. When I go back and reread things, as you know, we all periodically do when I look at a poem, look at a picture again. I'm looking for that, that thing that I missed the first time, because</font>	Transcription
3337.41	3342.63	<font color='sienna'>it's not really possible to take the whole of it in at one glance.</font>	Transcription

3353.01	3361.98	<font color='indigo'>someone who writes them, and someone who reads them, because, you know, while I mean, sloppy reading is one thing, and let's just put that to the side. I mean, I think if you read something, and you</font>	Transcription
3361.98	3371.64	<font color='indigo'>don't, if someone's not paying attention to what you have put forward on the page, and they want to make it completely their own thing, well, then go write another poem, that that's something else.</font>	Transcription
3371.88	3388.41	<font color='indigo'>But it seems to me that once I write something, it goes out into the world. And then there's someone like me on the other end, who says, you know, who is to know precisely precisely what Robert Hayden</font>	Transcription
3388.44	3403.92	<font color='indigo'>or anyone whose poetry has been important to me what exactly they meant. They've given us something. And then I think it's our job and our great fortune, to be able to regard it, pay close attention</font>	Transcription
3403.92	3416.43	<font color='indigo'>to it and then make the associations that we that we will, I think that that's, that's what makes art great and that's what makes it more than just a telephone call.</font>	Transcription
