11.32	25.72	Sonia, Gwen said in one of her poems, this is the urgency and conduct, you're looming in the noise of the whirlwind. I know because of our long association, that	Transcription
25.78	41.32	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
25.78	41.32	it has not always been easy to be a black poet in the second half of the 20th century, or the first decade of the 21st century. Could you talk about that a little bit? How have	Transcription
41.32	44.08	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
41.32	44.08	there been those difficulties?	Transcription
44.72	52.37	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
44.72	52.37	Well, you know, I think that it's been difficult, you know, all the years that we've been here in this place called America being writers, or even poets,	Transcription
52.37	62.9	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
52.37	62.9	because you do know that teaching an English department, they really didn't think that we belong there, because it is called English department. However, we did go there. And we	Transcription
62.9	74.15	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
62.9	74.15	did make somewhat of a [inaudible] splash. But also what you know, reading early literature, you understood family, how difficult it was, for Du Bois, how difficult it was for	Transcription
74.15	86.81	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
74.15	86.81	Phillis Wheatley, how difficult it was for Delany and all those people, Zora to write and to be accepted as writers have, in this whole interesting thing called writing in	Transcription
86.81	97.46	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
86.81	97.46	America, of what they call the canon, the literary canon. And quite often we, ourselves are not even accepted into that canon, at this stage of the game, after all of these	Transcription
97.46	107.72	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
97.46	107.72	years, of really what I call invigorating this thing called American writing. That's what we've done, we have invigorated and stretched it, when you began to include	Transcription
108.29	122.45	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
108.29	122.45	black writing, in, in this writing, then it opened up to Native American writers, it opened up to Jewish writers, I mean, in within the genre, it opened up to Asian writing,	Transcription
122.81	133.88	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
122.81	133.88	women's writing, you know, lesbian studies, or gay studies. And what it did is it is spread all out and says, simply, you know, here we is, you know, it is not all about European	Transcription
133.88	146.51	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
133.88	146.51	writing. And that made for such an interesting way of looking at the world and looking at literature. I mean, you had, we have this very wonderful literature that goes on and	Transcription
146.51	156.77	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
146.51	156.77	says, You got to look at something called westward expansion with a different eye, you know, than saying, by golly, by gee, we were just going out west to expand, no, you also	Transcription
156.77	166.04	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
156.77	166.04	kill a whole lot of people, you know, doing that also, too. So all that was necessary. So that meant that you had to look at the words of the Native Americans, you know, you had	Transcription
166.04	176.78	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
166.04	176.78	to understand that this was not just them, chanting going Ooga booga booga, like the African writing, you know, ay, ya-ya, woo-woo, but listen, and we did that we brought that	Transcription
176.78	188.12	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
176.78	188.12	within that arena. And I remember once reading in the Midwest, and the Native American person came up to me and said, our sister Sanchez, when you chanted, I heard my	Transcription
188.12	199.1	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
188.12	199.1	people. And I remember leaning back, I leaned back on my own breath, and felt his breath and knew the connection, which was so important to us. Because at first, she was so	Transcription
199.13	208.73	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
199.13	208.73	interested in bringing just the word of the African American writing, that you didn't always hear other people breathing around you. But once you were able to firm yourself and look	Transcription
208.76	218.72	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
208.76	218.72	out at the world at the diaspora, you heard other breasts, you smell other breasts, you heard other chat, you say, this is the same chat. These are the same words. And these are	Transcription
218.72	229.58	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
218.72	229.58	the same kind of things that are are happening. When I went to China in 73. We were in Hong Kong waiting for a train. And this Chinese man came Darden across the we were the	Transcription
229.58	238.64	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
229.58	238.64	first group, after Nixon had climbed the Great Wall of China. And so we had people like Candice Bergen and Alice Childress, and, you know, all kinds of people go in there,	Transcription
238.64	251.39	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
238.64	251.39	the San Francisco mime troupe, the the people have been quite listed, you know, in America at McCarthy. Those riders were on that trip. And this Chinese man came running across	Transcription
251.39	261.47	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
251.39	261.47	those rapes the train station, crazy in ragged clothes, Everybody jump and ask students, Hey, how you doing brother? Because they I've seen you in Harlem, you know, I've seen	Transcription
261.47	271.85	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
261.47	271.85	you in Chicago. I've seen you in Alabama. Hello, how you doing? You know. So it's the same, you begin to understand that then you understand your literature more and you	Transcription
271.85	274.91	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
271.85	274.91	understand the world's literature more also to writing	Transcription
276.09	287.31	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
276.09	287.31	frenetic chaos that we are so used to. A young woman stood up by yesterday in the conference and talked about being from Pakistan and how we have to make a	Transcription
287.31	299.97	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
287.31	299.97	connection with women in Pakistan because our experiences of women in this country are similar to those that she experienced growing up there. And I thought about the theme	Transcription
300.48	314.19	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
300.48	314.19	The conference at least a sub being cross pollination in the diaspora, because we have to understand that our poetry has stretched far beyond our boundaries, and has impacted many,	Transcription
314.19	323.49	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
314.19	323.49	many people. And I know that your poetry has done that, because you are affectionately called the poet of the universe. And what are you calling people calling you?	Transcription
324.21	334.5	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
324.21	334.5	I don't know. But the point is that I think we have learned, you know, that we all have the same voice. As I said before, when I was in China in 73, and I was	Transcription
334.5	347.4	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
334.5	347.4	reading my poetry at University of Beijing, when the process of our professor Sanchez, and we understand this really well, they said, what you said, we've been in Shanghai, and	Transcription
347.4	358.65	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
347.4	358.65	he said, you know, and you're talking about your black experience, he said, but you know, here in China, they had signs in Shanghai to said, No, Chinese are dogs allowed. So	Transcription
358.65	368.61	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
358.65	368.61	what you do is that you understood, it was, indeed, that oppression, against people of color was a real oppression all over the world. And so we began to write what we wrote,	Transcription
368.76	378.24	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
368.76	378.24	at some point, initially, we thought, this is just this experience, this is just my pain. And I had to tell people, by golly, by GE, this is all our pain, you know, here, and	Transcription
378.24	389.01	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
378.24	389.01	you know, all of it. So therefore, the greatest thing I think that happened to me, and probably to you, and a lot of us, you know, in this field, is that we taught, you know,	Transcription
389.01	398.82	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
389.01	398.82	and then teaching, I always say to people, teaching makes you writing and teach, you will keep you human, you know, because you will be in a classroom, I remember teaching at	Transcription
398.82	409.92	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
398.82	409.92	Temple University up at them, of the art campus, and this young white man walked in with his hair or died, and he's very obviously was gay. And I was in my classes, you know,	Transcription
409.92	419.01	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
409.92	419.01	in a circle, and nobody wanted to grab his hand. So I grabbed his hand and told this young woman, you grab his hand, you know, and I held on very tightly. And I said,	Transcription
419.04	429.09	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
419.04	429.09	you're in this circle, you know, everyone's in this circle. And he was such a great rider, that by the third week, everybody wants to hold his hand. So it is important for us	Transcription
429.12	440.22	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
429.12	440.22	as writers, you see, I did a long essay, the poet is the creator of social values, we who create these things, we who say and set the tone for history, we're not 11 happened,	Transcription
440.28	451.38	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
440.28	451.38	where did they go, they didn't go to the diplomats, they went to the poets, they help us understand this tragedy, help us to understand what has happened, help us to breathe,	Transcription
451.53	460.95	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
451.53	460.95	because we're not breathing. Now. It's predictable, help us to live. And writers and poets have always helped people to live. And the question that must be answered here in the	Transcription
460.95	469.32	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
460.95	469.32	21st century, is that, what does it mean to be human? If? If we don't answer that question, We're all doomed. You know, this is like, this is not like, what does it mean to be	Transcription
469.32	477.99	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
469.32	477.99	human? If you're black? Or if you're Puerto Rican? Or if you're Asian? Or if you're gay? Or if you're Jewish? Or if you're Muslim of whatever? No, what does it mean to be human	Transcription
478.35	486.72	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
478.35	486.72	on this earth? Because if you don't ask, this earth is gonna swell as whole as our beings, the years for some more of you to come out of the sea. I mean, this is serious business	Transcription
486.72	498.15	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
486.72	498.15	going on right now at this particular time. So I say to my students all over, we've got to begin to answer this question in a very real concerted effort, you know, no, half	Transcription
498.15	504.0	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
498.15	504.0	slotting, he had no half step in here at all, these are serious times period, you have to	Transcription
504.24	512.91	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
504.24	512.91	remember that, when you talk that year at Lincoln University, it must have been 1975	Transcription
512.94	520.23	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
512.94	520.23	sure was, oh, that was too late. No, maybe it was later, that was about 77 or 78.	Transcription
522.48	535.68	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
522.48	535.68	I remember coming to your class, and you did the ritual of holding hands, at the end of the class, making the circle making the circle. Students say something	Transcription
536.07	550.77	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
536.07	550.77	supportive, something positive about someone in the class, and I picked up ritual. I don't do it at the end of every class. But I certainly do it at the end of every semester.	Transcription
551.61	565.89	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
551.61	565.89	But the whole idea is to how whole idea is to really come up with a way of making the students feel connected. And when you do that, in the classroom model, what can be done in the	Transcription
565.89	578.61	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
565.89	578.61	community, outside the classroom in the you model, what can be done in the world? And it seems to be your perspective, has always been the extended community.	Transcription
580.29	588.45	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
580.29	588.45	I mean, even when we first came on the scene, and you know, one of the things that you see is happening, when people really want to, in a sense, not open their eyes	Transcription
588.45	600.87	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
588.45	600.87	and listen, I'm always so surprised that people who have formed an opinion of you in 1965, and they still have their opinion in 2004. It shows two things is shows that the	Transcription
600.87	612.6	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
600.87	612.6	person has not grown and the person thinks to have now grown. It's like the great. Breck, you know, did did used to do dude like this little small pieces similar to what Baraka	Transcription
612.6	626.04	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
612.6	626.04	does, you know? And he says in it a friend came up and said, How are you doing? How are you doing? How are you feeling? You know? And he says, I'm doing fine, I'm doing fine. He	Transcription
626.04	635.16	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
626.04	635.16	says that you haven't changed a bit. And, and he and he looked at him in a very strange way. And so there's something wrong with that, but because if you haven't seen	Transcription
635.16	643.38	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
635.16	643.38	him in 20 years, Moses, you better believe that change. The wrinkle here is for a reason, you know, you know, the creases for a reason, you know, the gray hairs for a reason,	Transcription
643.38	651.93	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
643.38	651.93	you know, I don't I make someone say, Well, why don't you just dye that hair so new, so then I don't tell your age, because then people won't know, I want people to know that I	Transcription
651.93	660.93	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
651.93	660.93	have lived these years, I want people to know that this is what this is about. And this right here came from a demonstration, you know, when I turn and I was knocked down,	Transcription
660.93	669.36	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
660.93	669.36	you know, and I got up, couldn't get to ice, because I wasn't in my house, putting ice on it. So therefore, every time initially, when someone looked as Oh, God, Sonia,	Transcription
669.36	678.63	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
669.36	678.63	that's terrible there. And I looked at and I said, you know, uh huh. It could be terrible, but it could be for a reason, too. And I think everything is for a reason you see at some	Transcription
678.63	689.16	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
678.63	689.16	particular point. And I think that is what is important. I was just in Rome, for this great interdependence day. And you have prime ministers and, and diplomats from all over	Transcription
689.16	699.66	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
689.16	699.66	the world. And I opened the conference, but upon that I did about interdependence day, because the theme is that we're all interdependent, as, as, as people, you know, in our own	Transcription
699.66	707.7	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
699.66	707.7	countries, and our separate countries, and then in the world, countries are interdependent. And when we truly understand that, then we move on a different level with each	Transcription
707.7	716.64	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
707.7	716.64	other. Because then you don't say to a person on when a bomb you bomb me, then I bomb you Next, when you're interdependent. You go to people then who can say how do we	Transcription
716.64	720.21	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
716.64	720.21	reconnect, because we've gotten denote a disconnected at some point?	Transcription
721.079	737.009	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
721.079	737.009	Because I was thinking that there must be some people in Iran today, who are so convinced that they are being under the under attack. I'm sure they have in	Transcription
737.009	751.979	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
737.009	751.979	their heads, this poem by county column, if we must let it not be like hawks hunted and pinned, and then something boys, but we have to really understand that. They are just	Transcription
751.979	761.039	"<font color=""#008080""><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>"	Speaker
751.979	761.039	like us, they feel like us. Sometimes. We let the media convince us that what is going on over there has no connection with	Transcription
761.97	767.49	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
761.97	767.49	that county. Yeah, yeah, I was just saying that. That's, that's that. That's that county? Oh,	Transcription
767.55	768.09	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
767.55	768.09	I'm sorry.	Transcription
768.24	776.04	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
768.24	776.04	Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, well, correct. A B o'clock. Okay. Yeah, if you die.	Transcription
778.77	792.18	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
778.77	792.18	My sister. What we truly understand at some point, is that we have all over the world, bunches of old men and women, you know, who had no one way to deal with the world. And	Transcription
792.18	803.52	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
792.18	803.52	that is through fire, through killing, to bombings, through, you know, oppression, whatever. What we're saying at some point, what I try to say to the young people yesterday, is	Transcription
803.52	811.74	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
803.52	811.74	that there's a new way of looking at the world. And one of the ways that we have moved our poetry, you know, going from one point to another point, when I first came on the scene	Transcription
811.77	821.16	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
811.77	821.16	as other people came on the scene, we didn't know we had been enslaved. So we went into the libraries of wild God, we were enslaved, no one total for is a moment in time I was in	Transcription
821.16	831.18	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
821.16	831.18	slavery, we found that out, what do we do? We attacked everybody, then everybody didn't matter who you are, like, even our parents, so America said, How could you attack me?	Transcription
831.33	841.38	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
831.33	841.38	I've been good to you. Why are you calling me those names? Like why it whatever I know. Because I said to someone funny blog post folks have always called you names. Only because	Transcription
841.38	849.63	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
841.38	849.63	we had no power. So the best thing to do was like and I said that, but that's a black thing. I mean, that's like when I grew up, you know, in Holland, you played the dozens, you	Transcription
849.63	861.51	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
849.63	861.51	know, your signified on people. So I said to an endless interview with someone that BJ never printed times I said, this is about signifying, you know, so you cannot review a	Transcription
861.51	871.74	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
861.51	871.74	book of my poetry or anybody's poetry, unless you understand the culture of the people, you assume that you raised us all just like Topsy. We are saying you do not raise us like	Transcription
871.74	881.64	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
871.74	881.64	Topsy, you know, we come with new information. So when I write this particular poem, you've got to come in information, for instance, when I used to teach, and I came	Transcription
881.64	892.53	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
881.64	892.53	across a poem, and that's in that is he into mystical stuff here, you know, is he into whatever. So there was some authority on yated. I knocked on his door, a temple, and I	Transcription
892.53	900.9	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
892.53	900.9	sat down, I sat down with him. He said, Sorry, you're right. Very few people pick that up. And I said, Oh, because I was another poet meeting him. So I said, What Talk to me about	Transcription
900.9	910.14	"<font color=""navy""><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>"	Speaker
