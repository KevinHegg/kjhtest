17.0	31.97	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
17.0	31.97	All right. Wow. Elizabeth, I wanted to start out by asking you a question that it seems to me your work really bears to mind. And it's about the relationship between your work and	Transcription
31.97	43.13	the African diaspora, particularly one of the things that I noticed about your work is that you really kind of both embrace ideas about race, but also question the boundaries of it. If you think about	Transcription
43.22	53.3	'West Indian Primer', where you're talking about both your Jamaican ancestry and then how it moves beyond that, or if you think about your poem for Nelson Mandela, where you start talking about, you	Transcription
53.3	66.14	know, 'I am a black daughter', but in a way that connects to the South African president, and in an interesting way. Could you talk about the relationship between your work and a diasporic context?	Transcription
66.96	76.71	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
66.96	76.71	Well, that reading that you just gave of that line, 'I am a black daughter', that break-- It seems to me, and I'm just now thinking about this, echoes Gwendolyn Brooks' great poem	Transcription
76.71	88.74	where she talks about 'I am a Black', 'I am one of the Blacks', where she feels that to be called merely African American is limiting and almost in a way euphemistic. That it skips over an	Transcription
88.74	100.92	understanding of how we are all connected to each other, across the globe. Sometimes in our actual histories, in the case of the Jamaican grandfather there's a lot of personal history in my poems as	Transcription
100.92	115.11	you know, or in newer poems. My husband is from Eritrea, so now I have a whole East African connection going on. But in a way, I think what we learn from those real histories is how complicated and	Transcription
115.11	128.76	sometimes nostalgic and sometimes full of fantasy, the idea of Africa is for us. You know, and I think that as African Americans, we have always tried to connect to that idea, because so much has been	Transcription
128.97	141.33	cut off and interrupted. But at the same time, it's a fantasy, though I think it is a heartfelt and beautiful fantasy that has led many of us, myself included, to reading and learning and reaching out	Transcription
141.33	155.52	and exploration and trying to theorize in very personal terms	Speaker
141.33	155.52	and exploration and trying to theorize in very personal terms: What does it mean to be African people in this diaspora all across the world? I think also one of the beautiful realities of the United	Transcription
155.52	169.05	States, and for me of growing up in Washington, DC, is that you met Black people from all over the world. And that's something I touch on as well, something that was very important to my own African	Transcription
169.05	182.91	American grandmother growing up in Washington, DC. She would go and sit on the steps of embassies, because it let her imagine the world. And so that was a fortunate thing to grow up with just that	Transcription
182.91	185.73	sense that we are, we are a multi-people.	Transcription
186.38	196.25	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
186.38	196.25	It's-- I love hearing you talk about that. Because in that poem that, where you actually invoke your grandmother sitting on the steps of embassy row, you have the line where you talk	Transcription
196.25	206.75	about what is a princess like in 'Feminist Poem Number One', what is, uh, what your grandmother would call and say to her-- her international friends, I am an American Negro, right, and what is an	Transcription
206.75	218.51	American Negro princess? And so in some ways, I think that hearing you talk about that-- and then in that same poem you actually refer to your husband and then talk about, you know, as an Abyssinian.	Transcription
218.51	229.67	And so its interesting how, within the context of one poem, both in terms of gender relationships, in terms of how that intersects our ideas about race and our ideas about kind of connections to	Transcription
229.67	241.52	Africa, that all gets kind of wrapped up into that, as well as class, right? Because anytime you kind of invoke these ideas about the princesses, it's the sense of the grandmother who wants to travel	Transcription
241.52	250.67	to see the world and you have traveled to see the world, right. Within the context of the line, for the poem the husband that takes you to the airport for a passport, which means of course that	Transcription
250.67	250.76	you're--	Transcription
250.76	251.42	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
250.76	251.42	Going somewhere.	Transcription
251.42	263.99	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
251.42	263.99	You're going somewhere, right, and eventually coming back. And so I think that's really a useful way to think about it. But even domestically, I find that your work covers so many	Transcription
263.99	279.86	different kinds of Black artists and authors and photographers and athletes from Mohammed Ali to James Van Der Zee to Paul Robeson to Romero Bearden, and I'm wondering if you'd be interested in	Transcription
279.86	293.51	talking a little bit about, about myth, right, and Black mythic figures and major historical figures that seem to occur in your work. And I note that my list-- at this moment I'm using Black male	Transcription
293.51	302.48	figures because we started, um I moved in a bit of a different direction, but even your, in, Nat Turner poem. Right? So if, would you comment on that?	Transcription
302.51	316.43	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
302.51	316.43	Well yeah, I mean, I think our history, our culture is so rich, it's so under explored, it's so distortedly imagined, that it just has always seemed to me that that is an infinite	Transcription
316.43	329.75	mother lode for poetry. I think in some ways, what that speaks to biographically is that I spent a lot of time in school and in universities, although when I think about the reading, that gave me my	Transcription
329.75	343.4	information, very often, it was actually autodidactic study, it was not always what I was learning in school. But nonetheless, that context, that idea of reading to know, reading as experience that is	Transcription
343.4	358.43	deeply, deeply felt, and taken in reading as being-- and learning, as somehow on a, an equivalent plane to the things that you know from living your life without books. You know, to those of us for	Transcription
358.43	371.33	whom culture is that important, I think it's important to assert that it's lived life, it's real experience. So calling all of that in, being a scholar of African American culture, you know, it's what	Transcription
371.33	382.55	I teach, it's what I've been thinking about for a long time, I find that poems are a great place to work with that. That said, this whole idea of myth, you know, I, the word Abyssinian,	Transcription
382.61	382.88	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
382.61	382.88	Yes.	Transcription
382.91	385.13	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
382.91	385.13	You know that that's, that's an old timey word,	Transcription
385.0	388.36	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
385.0	388.36	No, not at all! Of course, of course, I do know that, so.	Transcription
385.13	385.76	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
385.13	385.76	Right, of course it is! Exactly.	Transcription
385.25	389.72	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
385.25	389.72	That's not what you call people today, from Eritrea.	Transcription
389.68	400.63	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
389.68	400.63	So you know, that whole, you know that to me, yeah, I think where did it come from? That was a magical word. One of those sort of elsewhere words, one of those elsewhere Black	Transcription
400.63	408.25	people words, that has appealed to me from God knows what sources from as long as I can remember.	Transcription
408.14	419.299	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
408.14	419.299	Yes, yes. Thank you so much. Well, it's interesting hearing you talk about kind of-- in that context, you being a scholar of African American culture, and a teacher in points being	Transcription
415.98	505.11	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
415.98	505.11	Yeah. Well, I mean, I think one of the things, you know, when you're taught close reading as a method in graduate study and undergraduate study English classes, it should be	Transcription
419.361	431.76	the space where you're able to kind of explore this mother lode, because I'd actually like to talk a little bit about your newest work, 'The Black Interior'. And one of the things, you know, first off	Transcription
431.822	443.912	that is different, right, is that it's a collection of essays, unlike your previous three books before that. And it strikes me that it is at once both scholarly, but also attempting to speak to a	Transcription
443.974	456.311	larger community that is not just dealing with issues of books, right, we have essays in there, one on Julia Cooper, of course, so that's definitely in the kind of intellectual or readerly tradition.	Transcription
456.373	468.711	But you have an essay on Denzel Washington, right? You have an essay on Rodney King. You have an essay, my goodness on jet, right? 'Notes Toward a Notion of Race-Pride'. And so there's a way in which	Transcription
468.773	480.862	I really see your work as working with both, kind of, the African American scholarly tradition in terms of literary culture, but also and I think in important ways, more broadly, popular culture,	Transcription
480.924	493.262	right, in ways that I think, are useful for students, right? Because I know that, that you also teach. Could you talk about kind of the role that you see 'Black Interior' playing in the trajectory of	Transcription
493.324	495.06	your work as a writer? And--	Transcription
505.11	508.26	applicable to anything that constitutes a text.	Transcription
508.26	508.53	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
508.26	508.53	Yes.	Transcription
509.02	521.86	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
509.02	521.86	So there was actually a wonderful article by Stanley Fish, your UIC colleague, at, in the New York Times where he was-- had his students do close readings of a speech by Bush, a	Transcription
521.86	534.25	speech by Kerry. And he talked about repetition, assonance, all the, the-- what we think of as poetic devices of how people do or don't get their message across. How language works on us. So I think	Transcription
534.25	547.75	those tools, we should be able to turn them anyplace. And while I do think that there are all kinds of things that you can say about, you know, 'poetry is not jet magazine'. But, at the same time, how	Transcription
547.75	559.51	does our culture manifest itself? How does it live in people who don't necessarily call themselves professional artists? And how do a lot of the issues that are of importance in our poetry and in our	Transcription
559.51	573.91	popular culture cross back and forth. I'm very interested in that. The book, as you know, was a long time coming, and in many ways that long time is a testimony to the challenges of finding a prose	Transcription
573.91	589.06	voice. You know, when an academic, a more conventionally academic voice didn't feel like a jacket that fit. And at the same time, I wanted to bring in what I know as an artist, how I look at the world	Transcription
589.06	601.27	as an artist, and I wanted to operate in a tradition of belles lettres that is exemplified by people like June Jordan, who's a very, very important figure to me, and who's an incredibly important	Transcription
601.27	606.49	essayist, and I believe, has published more essays than any Black woman in history.	Transcription
606.55	607.0	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
606.55	607.0	Yes.	Transcription
607.06	609.49	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
607.06	609.49	I'm pretty sure that that's, that that's true.	Transcription
609.52	609.82	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
609.52	609.82	Yeah.	Transcription
610.56	625.44	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
610.56	625.44	And so what does it mean to, in the way that I love, to listen to a smart person with a wide field of reference, hold forth. Felicitously. I wanted to be that person in writing.	Transcription
625.74	643.74	And I think that actually also within Blackness, we, we have so many great raconteurs, we have so many oral geniuses who can hold forth, in a way that is just amazing. And so I think that somehow also	Transcription
643.74	656.19	those patterns of address and argument were somehow underneath and in there as well. But finding that voice was challenging. And now that the book is out there, you know, my, my wish and my hope is	Transcription
656.19	660.15	that it find its readers. And I think that's a slow process too.	Transcription
660.24	661.77	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
660.24	661.77	Oh, absolutely, absolutely.	Transcription
661.77	662.46	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
661.77	662.46	Yeah, but that's okay.	Transcription
662.51	672.32	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
662.51	672.32	Right. Well, I-- well in, within the context of the readership or audience of 'Black Interior', I think different people will come to the book with different needs and expectations.	Transcription
672.35	686.42	And so the nice thing about kind of the aspect of it being a work that looks at different aspects of Black culture in very diverse ways. And also, I think, using a language that is not an academic	Transcription
686.42	696.38	straightjacket, you know, in terms of, as a scholar of African American literature, the tradition, in terms of the scholarly tradition, there's certain expectations about language and kind of	Transcription
696.41	705.44	heightened language, or what is recognized or thought of as theoretical language. And yet, I find in 'The Black Interior', if you think, for example of your essay on Michael Harper, who I know has	Transcription
705.44	719.09	been an influence on you, that there is a way in which you, you use insightful close readings, right, of some of his, of his poems from 'Dear John, Dear Coltrane', and poems, on Bessie Smith, for	Transcription
719.09	733.49	example, but not terminology, that someone who has not taken, you know, American poetry 101 at Yale University would not be able to understand. And I think that's really important terms of thinking	Transcription
733.49	741.38	about kind of the artist and her relationship to community, right, and to audience in really, really useful ways.	Transcription
741.44	752.81	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
741.44	752.81	And I think also there's something interesting, I haven't, I'm just thinking of it this very moment, but something interesting about hierarchy and apprenticeship, in the ways that	Transcription
753.23	764.21	people are quoted, other experts and colleagues are quoted in the essays. But my dad read some of them in an earlier phase, he said, Why do you have to quote 10 people to say what you're trying to	Transcription
764.21	767.75	say? Just say what you're trying to say, and-- you're you're a grown up.	Transcription
767.78	768.2	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
767.78	768.2	Right.	Transcription
768.23	776.6	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
768.23	776.6	Say what you're trying to say. But of course, you know, in, in academic writing, you have to quote 10 other people, who said what you said first, in order to say what you have to	Transcription
776.6	793.31	say. And yet I do think that there is something within our oral communities about earning the right to speak, and about moving through ancestral wisdom and knowledge in order to have your moment to	Transcription
793.31	800.84	hold forth. So I think that there are different ways of sort of moving through those channels, to your moment in the sun.	Transcription
801.23	809.9	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
801.23	809.9	Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that. Because when you think about the kind of oral communities or oral culture in the way that it's associated with Back cul-- Black culture as an oral	Transcription
809.9	823.82	culture. Though, of course, in terms of scholarship, people are questioning that as a too easy identification. But one thing I noticed in your poetry is that, and you mentioned this at a conference at	Transcription
823.82	837.23	Yale a few years ago, where you're talking about kind of giving voice to Black female figures within our history, that you seem to not be able to find in the historical record, a record of their	Transcription
837.23	846.26	voice, right? And so you have the poem 'Yolande Speaks' right, in which you think about all the literature about Dubois, and even though you know, Gerald Horne has done a wonderful biography of	Transcription
846.26	860.84	Shirley Dubois, that Dubois' daughter, right, his only daughter, we don't hear her voice as much in the historical record. And there's a there's a way in which, you know, poems such as that where you,	Transcription
860.87	872.06	you have her not only have a voice or-- but a perspective, right? She's like	Speaker
860.87	872.06	you have her not only have a voice or-- but a perspective, right? She's like: 'I've laughed/ at my father's gloves// and spats' which both humanizes him but also gives her kind of a sense of distance	Transcription
872.06	884.0	from him to kind of have a perspective on, on him.  Or your, your first book of poetry, 'The Venus Hottentot', which, which opens with, you know-- although it opens with Cuvier by the time we get to	Transcription
884.87	896.18	Saartjie Bartman's voice, right, You have her being insistently multilingual, right? I speak English, I speak French, I speak Dutch and I even speak 'languages Monsieur Cuvier/ will never know have	Transcription
896.18	911.57	names'. There's a way in which I think that your work really does speak to the need for an awareness of this kind of orality as an aspect of Black culture without simplifying it.	Transcription
911.63	926.81	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
911.63	926.81	Mm hmm. Yes. And I think also with that moment in Venus Hottentot, the idea that we always are trying-- we always know more than we manifest. And that really interests me, both	Transcription
926.84	940.55	with myself, in my own continual-- I think it's a lifelong process of coming to voice, you know. You get there, okay, but then you keep moving forward, and really trying to process and distill all the	Transcription
940.55	951.38	knowledge and all the wisdom. But we always know more than we manifest. And she is a great exemplar of that. And I think that's a very interesting secret weapon.	Transcription
951.45	952.92	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
951.45	952.92	Yes, yes. Absolutely.	Transcription
952.92	953.88	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
952.92	953.88	That we need to think about.	Transcription
953.879	962.969	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
953.879	962.969	Absolutely. I wanna actually shift to talk about the visuals, [inaudible] by talking about the oral. And I brought with me, my beloved copies of,	Transcription
957.92	959.57	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
957.92	959.57	The babies.	Transcription
960.11	975.08	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
960.11	975.08	The babies! I'm sure they're your babies, but my copies of them. My duplicates, and one thing that really strikes me is your-- the, and I don't know what degree of control you have	Transcription
975.08	986.36	over this, whether it's your editors' choices, or whether you're involved in the selection of this, but the covers of your books, right, and the beautiful artwork that has-- and Black artwork, you	Transcription
986.36	991.82	know, in particular-- that has been a part of the process of your books. And I wondered if you could talk, um	Transcription
991.82	992.99	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
991.82	992.99	Yes, absolutely.	Transcription
992.0	998.75	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
992.0	998.75	a bit about each one. And I'm missing, I didn't bring with me, it's back in my office, the original, right, copy of The Venus Hott--	Transcription
998.75	999.86	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
998.75	999.86	But we can talk about that.	Transcription
999.839	1011.451	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
999.839	1011.451	But if we could, I thought it would be really useful. Because so much of your work-- Although I've made that kind of oral comment, there's also a way in which you have so many poems	Transcription
1010.82	1013.61	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1010.82	1013.61	That's right.	Transcription
1011.515	1024.155	that really deal with the visual image, right, and the concrete visual image, with visual artists, Bearden, Monet and so forth. The photographers. But, but there's a way in which I sense your work,	Transcription
1024.219	1036.858	and certainly in essays in 'The Black Interior', where you talk about how do Blacks relate to kind of the distortion of images of ourselves, and culture and-- without feeling the imperative to just	Transcription
1036.922	1038.719	only create positive images.	Transcription
1039.5	1044.24	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1039.5	1044.24	So if you could just talk about your book covers and visuality in general, I'd appreciate it.	Transcription
1044.0	1057.11	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1044.0	1057.11	Well, I've been very aggressive about controlling that. And with the first cover of 'The Venus Hottentot', that was University of Virginia press, many many years ago. And the	Transcription
1057.14	1067.76	first cover that was-- I thought, let's see what they come up with. As much as art is so important to me and as much as beautiful books are important to me. And what they came up with was a baby	Transcription
1067.76	1081.5	aspirin colored cover with scallop shells alluding as best I could see to Venus de Milo rising up out of the sea. And I thought, okay, so if after reading that poem, that is the title poem of that	Transcription
1081.5	1081.89	book--	Transcription
1081.92	1082.34	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1081.92	1082.34	Right.	Transcription
1082.93	1084.91	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1082.93	1084.91	all-- it sort of proves the thesis.	Transcription
1084.95	1085.31	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1084.95	1085.31	Yes.	Transcription
1085.37	1097.16	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1085.37	1097.16	You know, and, and what you see and what you imagine, is Venus de Milo coming out of the sea, and that the color in which you cast these poems is baby aspirin, pinky-peach.	Transcription
1097.16	1097.94	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1097.16	1097.94	Yes, yeah.	Transcription
1098.48	1105.68	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1098.48	1105.68	I got to take control of this. We, you can't sort of negotiate with that. You can't work with that. That's too far out.	Transcription
1105.68	1106.31	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1105.68	1106.31	That's so true.	Transcription
1106.33	1117.16	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1106.33	1117.16	So the the painting that I chose was a painting by Charles Alston, who's my great uncle, my mother's uncle, and it's called ballet dancer, and it's a picture of a Black woman--	Transcription
1117.19	1130.9	too bad the picture couldn't have been in color because you can see it's sort of yellows and olives. She looks a bit whiter colored than she actually is in the reproduction, but she has a kind of	Transcription
1130.93	1141.94	physical composure. That seemed to me to be very important as that relates to The Venus Hottentot. What does it mean to be that woman who's-- she's in leotards, her body is outlined and exposed, but	Transcription
1141.94	1157.03	yet, even though you are being watched, your inner life is your own. That was what I thought was in that implacable face in that, in that painting. And so ever after, you know I just, it was with	Transcription
1157.06	1166.45	'Body of Life' which is Tia Chucha press, they were very excited to have me find my own cover, and this is by a great painter, who's a friend of mine, Kerry James Marshall. And there's a lot of	Transcription
1168.1	1179.92	romantic dynamics in this book and this painting is called 'Could This be Love'. And just a fabulous painting with so many small details that you can just about make up	Speaker
1168.1	1179.92	romantic dynamics in this book and this painting is called 'Could This be Love'. And just a fabulous painting with so many small details that you can just about make up: the calendar stained with her	Transcription
1179.92	1192.43	menstrual blood, the sculpture, the Africanesque sculpture in the background echoing her form. All that Kerry James Marshall does with the black black that is not the color of anyone, but is a color	Transcription
1192.46	1210.28	of sort of mythos in a way. The songs in the background, he's saying, 'What a woman, what a woman, what a woman'. So there's just a lot you know, the, the Vodoun heart in there. So much going on, a	Transcription
1210.28	1224.8	very talky painting in a way that I think, communicates nicely with the paintings inside. Then in 'Antebellum Dream Book' again, the first cover that was given to me-- I said again, I'm at a new	Transcription
1224.8	1230.92	press, a press that I love, let me see what they do. And it was a picture of, you know I said it looked like the cover to Sounder.	Transcription
1231.13	1231.76	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1231.13	1231.76	Oh my goodness.	Transcription
1231.76	1243.13	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1231.76	1243.13	There's a Black girl on a porch, screen door, basket of produce. And I said, so how do you read that book and make that cover? Again, it speaks to me to-- how are they seeing us?	Transcription
1243.13	1244.24	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1243.13	1244.24	Yes, absolutely.	Transcription
1244.0	1254.53	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1244.0	1254.53	How, with, with the book in-- and so I said, can't work with this, we got to just start all over again. And this painting is Bob Thompson's 'The Garden of Music', which I just	Transcription
1254.56	1267.97	adore. And because there are dream poems in the book, I felt that there was a very dreamlike quality, a surreal quality to these wonderful purple people. And, you know, that, that it was a dreamscape	Transcription
1268.54	1280.75	in a way that I thought worked with the books, the poems inside. And then with Black Interior, we've spoken at the conference, Sonia Sanchez mentioned, the great Elizabeth Catlett. And this image is	Transcription
1275.35	1283.06	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1275.35	1283.06	So appropriate.	Transcription
1280.75	1282.28	called 'The Black Woman Speaks'	Transcription
1284.08	1292.96	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1284.08	1292.96	And there it is. And as I talk about in the book, what you can't see on the picture, on the side, there is a sort of a spiral that's inscribed on her temple, if you were to have a	Transcription
1292.96	1305.26	side view. And you know, the spiral is a symbol of infinity, and it seems to me that that it also suggests, it almost-- as though it's a drawing of what's inside the Black woman's head.	Transcription
1305.29	1305.8	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1305.29	1305.8	Yes, yes	Transcription
1305.89	1321.01	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1305.89	1321.01	An infinite, infinite spiral. And Catlett made this work in about 1970, when she herself was a very, very mature artist, mother of grown children. Which connects with my	Transcription
1321.01	1335.08	conversation of Gwendolyn Brooks, at the same point more or less in her life. A very senior woman, a very acclaimed artist, nonetheless subject to change, responsive to the times.	Transcription
1335.35	1337.18	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1335.35	1337.18	Willing to evolve.	Transcription
1337.0	1347.036	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1337.0	1347.036	Willing to evolve. And I think that, that was-- in addition to just that it's, it's a ravishing piece of work, it's a beautiful, beautiful sculpture. And it's it's also a nice	Transcription
1347.093	1358.391	picture of a sculpture, which is hard to do sometimes. But to me, you know, I'm interested in artists' careers over time, you know, want to be in it for the long haul. And so and that's why it's so	Transcription
1358.448	1361.66	fortunate to be here with people like Sonia and Lucille.	Transcription
1362.23	1364.96	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1362.23	1364.96	Because you see that long, tradition. Long tradition.	Transcription
1364.96	1372.43	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1364.96	1372.43	Long, and you know, and that these are people who have also-- I have small children, these are people who have raised children, who have made a life in the arts.	Transcription
1372.43	1377.23	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1372.43	1377.23	And mothers, and wives, and partners and all of these things and still been artists,	Transcription
1377.0	1382.58	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1377.0	1382.58	And scholars, and in so many ways and theorists of Black culture, right. And so.	Transcription
1377.26	1377.68	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1377.26	1377.68	Yes.	Transcription
1382.58	1389.36	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1382.58	1389.36	Yes, yes, yes. And so that's, those are the women that give me power, you know.	Transcription
1389.87	1401.96	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1389.87	1401.96	Me as well. I can definitely identify with that. Thank you so much for that. I want to ask a more just simply basic question, since I've been-- How do you know when you are ready to	Transcription
1401.96	1403.52	start or finish a poem?	Transcription
1403.57	1416.47	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1403.57	1416.47	Ooh. Well at this conference I have felt really ready to start a lot of poems. I think that being around poetry and being around people who make poetry makes new poems happen, you	Transcription
1416.47	1432.52	know. It's like this incredible, biodynamic thing that, that happens, you just sort of-- you take a word, you take a line, you take a sort of a modal imprint, and the poems are ready to come. And then	Transcription
1432.55	1441.43	for me, as for all of us, there's always the question of time, and where to find-- you know, I love that Lucille Clifton, when she was talking about what it was to have four children in diapers at the	Transcription
1441.43	1444.25	same time. And she said to the audience, you think you're busy?	Transcription
1444.4	1445.69	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1444.4	1445.69	Right. Right. Absolutely.	Transcription
1445.75	1456.97	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1445.75	1456.97	And she has spoken about actually how the ideal circumstances for her to write poetry became domestic chaos.  Because that's what it was. You know, that if you know, she says,	Transcription
1456.97	1466.45	one-- you're at the kitchen table, and one child's got the measles and the other child's got the homework and that everything is going on. Nonetheless, you somehow make that space. And I am working to	Transcription
1466.45	1476.74	do that as I think whether or not we have children we're always, in the midst of our lives, we all have to make a living. No poet is supporting him or herself solely by the word. So you're trying to	Transcription
1476.74	1491.23	make that bubble, or develop the habit that says, at least in my bag, the notebook is always there. Although, because driving ends up sometimes to be the only free time there is. Can't quite write the	Transcription
1491.23	1503.05	things down as well, you know, on the road, as well as you would like to. So it's that feeling though, which I'm having now which I'm having after this conference of being full up. And then you know,	Transcription
1503.17	1514.84	then there's process, process, process. But then the ready to be done with it is a tricky thing as well. I was speaking with some students recently about how you sort of go as far as you can, and then	Transcription
1514.84	1528.04	you leave it and come back to it after it's had time to sit. And then you can more clearly see, okay, was I just tired? Was I just out of ideas? Or maybe this really is done. Or maybe now I can see	Transcription
1528.19	1540.01	what the final tweak is. And I have poems that have remained in folders for years and years and years and years, snippets for years, that then you find, okay, this is how I can use this. This is how I	Transcription
1540.01	1541.06	can complete this.	Transcription
1542.56	1544.27	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1542.56	1544.27	So you revise your work alot?	Transcription
1544.33	1556.45	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1544.33	1556.45	Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, hopefully, what happens when you get lucky, is that there's a rush in the beginning, that at least gets a large chunk sketched out. Though, that then	Transcription
1556.45	1564.79	also will be revised and revised and revised. But I like when there's enough-- that mysterious enoughness to put the poem over the cliff.	Transcription
1565.45	1565.99	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1565.45	1565.99	Absolutely.	Transcription
1566.02	1576.7	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1566.02	1576.7	I can feel when I'm like, uhh, I'm not at the edge of the cliff. So I'm not there. And sometimes that stuff gets wasted or lost. But you know, one must be Zen about these things.	Transcription
1577.21	1578.44	You know, nothing is wasted.	Transcription
1578.5	1588.703	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1578.5	1588.703	Nothing, nothing, nothing. And do you have a favorite poem? Is there a poem of yours that you just-- I know, for example, I've memorized a number of your poems but this is as someone	Transcription
1588.759	1599.86	who's not-- is coming to it from a different perspective. And I'm just curious if, if you've memorized some of yours, do you have any poems that you just go like, I love this? Or is it each new poem	Transcription
1599.916	1601.15	is the favorite, or--?	Transcription
1601.01	1614.606	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1601.01	1614.606	Yeah, yeah. There are some that I'm extra proud of mostly because of the work. You know, the Venus Hottentot, I worked very, very hard on it, to keep those two voices distinct and	Transcription
1607.45	1675.61	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1607.45	1675.61	You can't even try to count on the cute. Don't count on the cute.	Transcription
1614.682	1629.873	consistent, and to really take myself into a very, very other world of imagination. So I was proud of it as work. In this new collection, I have a really long, a 25 page poem on the Amistad. I've been	Transcription
1629.949	1645.064	working on it for years. I've done a ton of research. You know, I'm proud of it, because it was hard, good work. And I tried to be meticulous and faithful. I mean, you know, you always are, but maybe	Transcription
1645.14	1660.332	it's the-- it's easier to be proud of the sort of bigger projects in a sense. But I think also moments in poems where I know I have been true, when I could have been cute? Meaning, just clever or, you	Transcription
1660.408	1675.523	know, a fancy word but maybe not the right word, or you know, a wonderful music, but only for its own sake, and not furthering anything in the poem. You know, moments where I have avoided cuteness or	Transcription
1675.599	1690.334	showiness, which has been ingrained in me as a modus operandi from a very early age. You know, my grandmother, if anyone said, you know, to any child in her world, you know, oh, you know, what a	Transcription
1690.41	1705.83	pretty little girl. 'And she is a very nice child'. You know, 'and she is a very bright girl. And she's a very kind girl'. That was and you know, with such a voice that said, you know, so don't even try.	Transcription
1702.37	1716.26	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1702.37	1716.26	Don't even puff up. Don't even puff up, you know, because it's the, the values of what make you a good human being. That that's what's important. So I think that as-- that's an,	Transcription
1716.41	1723.25	actually a very useful poetic value as well too. Just because you can doesn't mean you always should.	Transcription
1723.28	1734.32	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1723.28	1734.32	Right, right and so that you see that translation between them. Well, I actually have a poem that I'd like to hear you talk about, and it appeared in The New Yorker. That is, well, I	Transcription
1734.32	1743.2	have a number of favorite things, poems, on your corpus. But it's certainly one that I would love to hear you talk about. And it's 'When'.	Transcription
1744.52	1755.32	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1744.52	1755.32	Yes, well that, just this morning at the conference, Honorée Jeffers gave a great paper about blues, sort of a manifesto on blues poetics. And she was talking about different	Transcription
1755.35	1764.8	elements that make a contemporary blues poem. Because we're at a fascinating moment, you know, we're not Langston, we're not Sterling. We're not inventing the form of the blues poem in the middle of	Transcription
1764.8	1776.56	that music being widely distributed in record form. It's incredible when you read those Hughes and Van Vechten letters, when they're sending blues lyrics back and forth. Because as, you know, it's one	Transcription
1776.56	1784.66	thing to go and the dishwasher on the ship is singing the blues. But you know, for for records to be available. I mean, these are letters in the '20s.	Transcription
1784.69	1785.44	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1784.69	1785.44	Absolutely.	Transcription
1785.44	1796.84	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1785.44	1796.84	So it's new so I mean, wow, it-- hats off to Langston and then to Sterling brown for making the form in poetry, literary form that nonetheless comes out of the blues. But we're in	Transcription
1796.84	1810.34	a different moment. And what is the blues today and how is the blues aesthetic an element of African American culture that comes out in all sorts of different ways that aren't necessarily immediately	Transcription
1810.34	1820.54	identifiable as what Murray would call the blues as such, right? So she was talking about the blues, and she said that 'When' was a poem that she taught as a blues poem? And I said, Well, isn't that	Transcription
1820.54	1834.7	interesting? It's a sonnet. And to me, it was a sonnet in the mode of the Hayden sonnets, specifically 'Those Winter Sundays' in 'Frederick Douglass', which I think redefine what a sonnet can be. And	Transcription
1834.7	1844.24	then where my thinking took me, and I thought, well, what makes 'Those Winter Sundays', such a great Hayden sonnet is that the blues cracked open the sonnet form.	Transcription
1844.3	1845.11	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1844.3	1845.11	Absolutely.	Transcription
1845.32	1850.45	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1845.32	1850.45	And literally, the blues cracks open that poem. You know, 'What did I know, what did I know?'	Transcription
1851.02	1852.04	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1851.02	1852.04	'Of love's austere and lonely offices?'	Transcription
1852.04	1863.32	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1852.04	1863.32	I mean, you know, What did I know? You can just hear it spoken like that. So that reanimated the form. And I think it got at a way of talking-- you know, if the blue note is the	Transcription
1863.32	1879.58	space between the black and the white keys, I think that the blue note is a space of nuance, that is what I'm trying to explore in that poem. It's the nuance that is very specific about talking about	Transcription
1879.58	1889.18	these particular Black men, though it begins with a sweeping sort of magical generality. 'In the early 1980s, the black men/ were divine', you know, all of them, the Black men.	Transcription
1889.39	1892.03	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1889.39	1892.03	Could you read that? Would you be willing to read it? Now, would you all mind?	Transcription
1892.03	1893.17	Speaker Unknown	Speaker
1892.03	1893.17	Could you read that? Would you be willing to read it? Now, would you all mind?	Transcription
1893.23	1895.0	Yeah, I'm just-- are you gonna read it later today?	Transcription
1895.0	1896.89	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1895.0	1896.89	I was gonna read it later today. Oh, so we don't need to.	Transcription
1896.89	1897.61	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1896.89	1897.61	Oh, so then you don't need her to read it.	Transcription
1897.61	1898.18	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1897.61	1898.18	Okay. All right.	Transcription
1898.18	1898.45	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1898.18	1898.45	Oh I'm sorry.	Transcription
1898.51	1899.56	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1898.51	1899.56	All right. No, that's okay.	Transcription
1899.59	1900.19	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1899.59	1900.19	Okay then, yeah.	Transcription
1900.19	1906.79	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1900.19	1906.79	Um, but so, so, you know, there's that sort of sweeping beginning and then all of these particulars about these amazing Black men.	Transcription
1906.82	1907.21	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1906.82	1907.21	Okay.	Transcription
1907.21	1910.78	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1907.21	1910.78	You know, their style, their brilliance, their fabulosities, you know they--	Transcription
1911.38	1912.97	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
1911.38	1912.97	Their reading, they all quote Fanon. Right.	Transcription
1913.0	1924.19	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
1913.0	1924.19	That's right, I mean, you know, who are these men? And these were, these were-- I'm thinking specifically of a few men in the poem, particularly the poet Melvin Dixon. Who was so	Transcription
1924.19	1939.76	important to me, who died of AIDS, who, you know, to imagine him at this conference. And the likes of him, the likes of Essex Hemphill. You know, this is such a ghosty conference. And that was made	Transcription
1939.79	1950.68	visible to us last night, when we saw the people who have passed, and thinking, you know, about a June Jordan-- you know, all of the not here, not here, not here, not here. But Melvin was important to	Transcription
1950.68	1963.34	me also, because he was a real man of letters. I met him when he was on a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale when I was an undergraduate. He had already lived abroad, he had lived in Africa and France.	Transcription
1963.46	1977.38	That was just too fabulous for me, it was like the, you know, it was just very cool. And that he had translated, Senghor's work, he had translated criticism, was a poet, was a fiction writer, and	Transcription
1977.41	1991.63	didn't have any issues. You know, he said, if anyone has an issue with my working in these different modalities, that's their problem. You know, had his PhD, but just reconciled it all. And he was a	Transcription
1991.63	2007.5	very, very, very important model to me and was a kind, kind, big brother. In-- to me, he really, really was. Which is part of why I was so proud to to edit and bring out his last collection, 'Love's	Transcription
2007.5	2015.15	Instruments', a very great book. Yeah, that I'm happy is available. So he was anyway, he and others were behind that poem.	Transcription
2015.84	2016.71	Speaker Unknown	Speaker
2015.84	2016.71	Instruments', a very great book. Yeah, that I'm happy is available. So he was anyway, he and others were behind that poem.	Transcription

2019.47	2029.19	Okay so the short question that-- So the Chris question is the, um, well you're editing me so I can just say this, it's The Regenerating the Black Poetic Tradition question. You	Transcription
2029.19	2041.19	talked about Dixon being a big brother to you, and being so kind and generous, and so forth. And I certainly know, the younger generation of African American writers and poets, particularly, have all	Transcription
2041.19	2053.85	spoken of you so highly as a mentor, and as someone who has not only influenced them, but pushed them both in terms of the craft and the crafting of their verse. I believe it's Kevin Young, who in the	Transcription
2053.85	2064.77	anthology 'Giant Steps' says that, you know, you start that-- you're the first in that anthology by accident of your last name, but in fact, he says it's most appropriate because you really are seen	Transcription
2064.77	2079.2	as at the forefront, right of this generation of writers born from 1960 forward in that you've worked in so many genres, like Melvin Dixon, who you've spoken about, in certain ways. Could you talk	Transcription
2079.26	2088.32	just briefly about what Black poetic tradition means to you, and how you see yourself fitting within that?	Transcription
2089.43	2103.38	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
2089.43	2103.38	Well I, almost nothing makes me happier than those people recognizing, because I love them. And I can't even believe, you know, Kevin Young was in college and came to one of my	Transcription
2103.38	2114.63	poetry readings. And now I mean then he was a peer but now he's a different kind of peer. I mean, all of those people are on their second and third-- well you know, Honorée Jeffers, Van Jordan,	Transcription
2114.63	2116.85	Terrence Hayes, Natasha Tretheway.	Transcription
2116.97	2117.33	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
2116.97	2117.33	Major Jackson	Transcription
2117.36	2130.5	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
2117.36	2130.5	I mean Major Jackson, it's, it's an incredible, incredible moment. It really, really is. And I think that we are getting, never enough, but more of the institutional support that	Transcription
2130.5	2143.58	helps make our work visible. And that's really, really important. More of our books are available in more places. That's really important. Because, you know, Third World Press can't do everything.	Transcription
2143.73	2157.41	Broadside Press can't do everything. And these presses that have excluded us need to just join the-- join the new century, you know, if they missed the last century. And that's beginning to happen,	Transcription
2158.13	2166.74	people are teaching that makes a big difference. People are distinct from each other, people are having their arguments, and that's important too.	Transcription
2166.77	2169.26	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
2166.77	2169.26	Absolutely the disagreement. I agree, and I--	Transcription
2169.29	2178.71	"<font color=""indigo""><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>"	Speaker
2169.29	2178.71	So it's, it's an amazing amazing time I think and we're lucky to also have our elders with us to be able to look back and wonder.	Transcription
2178.8	2182.28	"<font color=""gray""><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>"	Speaker
